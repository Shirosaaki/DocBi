# Explanation

Here, I will explain to you the first code we have done.

## The code

```
000 0000000 {
    0110 n0
}
```

So, we have a few things to say. First, ```000 0000000``` is the declaration of the main function. In C, it is: ```int main()```.

Next, we have ```0110 n0```. ```0110``` = return and **n0** = 0, so in C: ```return 0;```.

And the program is finished!

## WARNING

All code MUST BE INSIDE a function, you can't write code ouside functions
