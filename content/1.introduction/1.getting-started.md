# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To start, you need to install Python and use Linux.

## Install the Compiler

To install the compiler, you have two choices:

1. Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Shirosaaki/bi).
2. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Shirosaaki/bi) and copy the code into your `.py` file.

## Test if Everything is Okay

Once you have installed the compiler, create a `.bi` file and add the following content:

```
000 0000000 {
    0110 n0
}
```

When you are finished, save and exit the file. Then, open a terminal and run:

::code-group
  ```[Normally]
  ./compilateur.py [yourbifile.bi]
  ```
  ```[If it doesn't work]
  python3 compilateur.py [yourbifile.bi]
  ```
::

If the compilation is successful, you can simply run ./a.out. If nothing happens, it means everything is working!


## WARNING

If you really want to learn this language, I recommend learning C first, as my language is very similar to C.

Additionally, there are many more tutorials available in C compared to BI.
