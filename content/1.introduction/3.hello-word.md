# Hello Word !

## Why hello word ?

Hello word is always the first stape of learn programming language, so why do otherwise ?

## How do Hello Word ?

In **C**, we have to way to do "Hello word !", in general, people do : ```printf("Hello Word !");```

But, we can do ```write(1, "Hello Word !", 12);```

The secondary way is linked to the assembly language and the `printf` function, which is an upgrade of `write`.

In **Bi**, we have only one way to write "Hello World!", which is `0100 "Hello World!"`.

At this point, you understand that in **Bi** we don't have parentheses or semicolons.

## Complete Program

So, if you want to write "Hello World!" without bugs, you need to write:

```
000 0000000 {
    0100 "Hello Word !"
    0110 n0
}
```
