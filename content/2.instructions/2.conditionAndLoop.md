# Condition and loop

## If and else

To make if instruction in **Bi**, it's easy, you just need to write ```0000 condition```

And for else, you need write ```0001```

### Exemple

```
000 0000000 {
    0000 n1 00110 n0 {
        0100 "1 = 0"
    } 0001 {
        0100 "1 != 0"
    }
    0110 n0
}
```

Here, we verify if **1 = 0**, we know this condition is false so the result print is **"1 != 0"**

## For

In **Bi**, the loop **for** is almost same that in **C**

for declare loop for, you need to write : ```0010 var 00101 number ; condition for stop ; step```

### Exemple

I want make a loop who write the first 100 integer, i write :

```
000 0000000 {
    0010 000000 00101 n0 ; 000000 01001 n1100100 ; 000000 10011 {
        0100 "Value : " 000000 ""
    }
    0110 n0
}
```

So, 0010 corresponds to for, 000000 is a variable that is declared only for the loop (in C, you can declare the variable before to save the value when the loop finishes, but in Bi, it is impossible). After, we have 00101 for "equals" and n0 for 0.

After the first semicolon, we have the condition. Here, we check if the variable 000000 is less than n1100100, which equals 100. After the second semicolon, we have the step, so 000000 10011 signifies var 000000++, meaning we have a step of one.

## While

While is exactly the same as in C but without parentheses.

## Logical operator

Now, i will give you, all logical operator for condition

1. **==** => **00110** (2x0 + 2x1 + 1x0)
2. **!=** => **00111** (2x0 + 3x1)
3. **>** => **01000** (1x0 + 1x1 + 3x0)
4. **<** => **01001** (1x0 + 1x1 + 2x0 + 1x1)
5. **>=** => **01010** (1x0 + 1x1 + 1x0 + 1x1 + 1x0)
6. **<=** => **01011** (1x0 + 1x1 + 1x0 + 2x1)
7. **&&** => **01100** (1x0 + 2x1 + 2x0)
8. **||** => **01101** (1x0 + 2x1 + 1x0 + 1x1)
