# Variable and number

## Type

In **Bi**, we have 4 type of variable, **INT**, **CHAR**, **CHAR \*(STR)** and **VOID**

**INT** = **INTEGER**

**CHAR** = **CHARACTER**

**CHAR \*** = **STRING**

**VOID** = **VOID**, it's generally for function who return nothing

## How use type in Bi ?

In **C**, you need write ```int varname [= ...];```, in **Bi**, is the same thing but with **0** and **1**

**INT** = **000**

**CHAR** = **001**

**CHAR \*** = **100**

**VOID** = **101**

## Declaration

In **Bi**, you have big restriction in the name and the number of variable because, you have utmost 64 variable name

Indeed, in **Bi**, variable names are a combination of six **0** and **1**. They start at **000000** and end at **111111**.

So, if you want to make an integer variable that equals 5, you will write `000 000000 00101 n101`.

If you have correctly read the instructions, I write `n101` to represent 5. Why? It's because in **Bi** you can't write numbers in base 10.

You need to write them in base 2 and you need to write `n` before to announce to the program that the next 1s and 0s will be numbers.

## Logical Operations

In all programming languages, we have logical operations with **+**, **-**, **/**, **%**, and **\***.

In **Bi**, it is exactly the same but with **0** and **1**:

1. **+** => **00000** (5x0)
2. **-** => **00001** (4x0 + 1x1)
3. **\*** => **00010** (3x0 + 1x1 + 1x0)
4. **/** => **00011** (3x0 + 2x1)
5. **%** => **00100** (2x0 + 1x1 + 2x0)
6. **=** => **00101** (2x0 + 1x1 + 1x0 + 1x1)
7. **+=** => **01110** (1x0 + 3x1 + 1x0)
8. **-=** => **01111** (1x0 + 4x1)
9. **\*=** => **10000** (1x1 + 4x0)
10. **/=** => **10001** (1x1 + 3x0 + 1x1)
11. **%=** => **10010** (1x1 + 2x0 + 1x1 + 1x0)
12. **++** => **10011** (1x1 + 2x0 + 2x1)
13. **--** => **10100** (1x1 + 1x0 + 1x1 + 2x0)

## Number

Like i said before, for write number in **Bi**, you need to write him in base 2, so how convert number in base 2 ?

To do this, you have two method, the first is easy, you go to google and you search a base convator

Or, you can convert manually and you have to way for this

The first way is count on your hands :

Or you can do this for big number :
